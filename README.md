Iâ€™m actively maintaining a personal blog in madarin Chinese, which is about summaries of papers/codes I read. 

Please jump to https://qingweiji.github.io/!

The topics include machine learning systems, distributed training, serverless computing, etc. 

Anyone is welcomed to leave comments and discuss with me!
