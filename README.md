Iâ€™m actively maintaining a personal blog in madarin Chinese, which is about summaries of papers/codes I read. 

Please jump to https://qingweiji.github.io/

The topics include machine learning scheduling systems, distributed training, LLM training/inference, etc. 

Anyone is welcomed to leave comments and discuss with me!
